`crawl` examples
----------------

This repository is a collection of examples and code snippets related to the R package `crawl`. The [Correlated RAndom Walk Library](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crawl) of R functions was designed for fitting continuous-time correlated random walk (CTCRW) models with time indexed covariates. The examples in this repository were previously included as demos within the `crawl` package.

1.  fur seal examples
2.  harbor seal examples
3.  shiny applications
4.  vignettes

how to explore and learn
------------------------

The easiest way to get started with these examples is to start a new project within RStudio and clone from this git repository. This will give you a local copy of the complete repository that you can run and explore on your machine. As updates are made to the repository over time, you can simply run a `git pull` and your local copy will be in sync with the latest version

contribute your own examples
----------------------------

We encourage you to develop and push your own examples to the repository. The more examples we have, the more `crawl` users can learn from each other. We will provide more details in the future, but for now, those familiar with typical GitHub pull request workflows (e.g. fork a copy to your account, submit pull request via the green button) should feel free to contribute.
